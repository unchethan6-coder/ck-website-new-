                To confirm your identity when we receive your request, we may need to
                verify that you are the same person whose information we have on record.
                This verification process may require us to ask for additional information
                from you that matches what we already have.
              </p>
              <p>
                For instance, based on the type of request you submit, we may request
                specific information to verify, or reach out to you using a previously
                provided communication method, such as phone or email. Other methods of
                verification may also be employed depending on the situation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The personal information you provide in your request will only be utilized
                to verify your identity and authority to make the request. We will aim to
                minimize the need to request additional information from you for
                verification purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                If our existing information is insufficient to verify your identity, we
                may ask for additional information to verify your identity, as well as for
                security and fraud prevention purposes. Once the verification process is
                completed, any additional information you provide will be promptly deleted.
